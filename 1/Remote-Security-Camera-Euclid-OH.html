<p>Nurse calling systems normally consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's washroom.

My mind conceptualized a technique of not just providing the customer with the patient-monitoring system but incorporating it into their old nurse call station system.</p>

Even if your system links to your smartphone, there are times when you may not remain in a position to do anything about an alarm going off, like when you're on a plane, in a crucial conference, or in an area without phone reception.
