After screening, we sent out each of our top choices, along with the Wyze Cam v2, to Expense McKinley, head of details security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's moms and dad company), for hack screening. (Bill is likewise a self-proclaimed paranoid infosec guy.") He assessed each camera for any outstanding security flaws and concluded that all of our top picks and the spending plan Wyze Camera passed basic security standards and defenses.</p>
<p>Everyone we dealt with at NSS were extremely practical and accommodating. The services they supplied were exactly what we wanted, and they performed with professionalism and skills.

Still, you're right about the Arlo Pro not doing anything to keep rain from striking the lens cover.</p>
<h2>Night Vision, Wireless & Wired Orono</h2>
<p>Ring may not be the most advanced system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), however it sure has actually gotten quite the fanfare for many years. We've been testing Ring Alarm quite a bit lately, and we actually like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a packaged security package that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring costs. Or ... no monitoring costs at all if you choose the free self-monitor" choice.</p>

<p>The House Smart Security Package, our previous runner-up, is still a strong choice for some people. Home has upgraded that version with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which offers a better range for sensing units. Both the original Residence system and the Abode Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only model we evaluated that also deals with HomeKit. We've come across a few technical issues while long-term testing the Home Iota, therefore will continue to test and update accordingly. We no longer advise it.</p>

And that's what Nest gives you.</p>
<p>Cloud storage: Tape-recorded video can be kept on the cloud in addition to on your video recorder. There are a couple of unique benefits to doing this, including having remote access to your videos and exceptional storage volume.

However, to save that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Likewise, the Blink doesn't offer you geofencing or two-way interaction, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations.
