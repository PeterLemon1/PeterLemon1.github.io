<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm, a number of companies provide "complimentary monitoring services" for the first couple of months. Numerous insurance companies use discounts on insurance premiums to customers with operable alarm. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many police departments offer a number of "complimentary" incorrect alarms before imposing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers bring into question the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or 4 complimentary false alarms per calendar year, due to the fact that they provide no up-front rewards to encourage owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
