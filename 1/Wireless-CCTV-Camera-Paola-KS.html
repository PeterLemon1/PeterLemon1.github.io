<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to strive to make a camera with the most hard setup understood to guy. Here's how it plays out: First you need to download the app and put in your email address. Then you go into the WiFi information of the network you're attempting to connect to. Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi information. (You should play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, dogs growl, cats scream, children cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
<p>What many individuals do not understand is that there is another class of security camera that is straight available to the public, though not discovered in the huge box and warehouse stores. These surveillance cameras are categorized as "commercial-grade" security cameras and are the kind of camera used by these huge box chains to secure their stock. Look at the ceiling of customer electronic devices stores and storage facility chains and you will notice in each aisle a white dome camera that is bigger than the average consumer camera. Let that sink in for a moment ... these companies do not even utilize the kind of cameras they are selling to the public, and there is a good reason.</p>

Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
