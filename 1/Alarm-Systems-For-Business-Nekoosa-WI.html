We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for among our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings.

<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a terrific security camera and an extraordinary value. It gets an Outstanding ranking for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests.
