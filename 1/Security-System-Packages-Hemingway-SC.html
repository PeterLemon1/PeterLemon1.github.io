Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape-record up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, in spite of showing up in the app's activity timeline.

<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
