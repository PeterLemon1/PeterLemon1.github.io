<p>Cameras with built in wifi that communicate with existing network requires an established wifi connection.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
