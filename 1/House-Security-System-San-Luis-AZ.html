<h3>Home Security Alarm Monitoring in Arizona</h3>
<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, signals, and integration all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
