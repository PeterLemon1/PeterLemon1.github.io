<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
