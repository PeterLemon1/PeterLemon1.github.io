<p>Everyone we handled at NSS were extremely useful and accommodating. The services they provided were exactly what we wanted, and they performed with professionalism and competence.

Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi information. (You should play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pets growl, cats squeal, babies weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never ever works.</p>
