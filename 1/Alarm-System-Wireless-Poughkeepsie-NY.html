Still, what you get for the cash is all the usual Arlo characteristics in terms of the solid build quality, superb camera footage, tons of smart functions and a polished app.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor.

Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
