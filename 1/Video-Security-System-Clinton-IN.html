Just transferred to Los Angeles and I believe I'm going to invest in a home security system for the first time. I like the mobility and low cost of Ring and SimpliSafe, but seems like ADT is still the very best alternative regardless of the higher cost. I guess when compared to the cost of my house, it's a pretty cheap rate to pay to keep it safe and protected.</p>
