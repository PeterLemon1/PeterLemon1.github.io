<p>Lots of full-time" citizens with alarm systems tell us that they are home all the time" and question why they would require monitoring. However, individuals need to consider the frequency and duration of their absences from home or business - instead of just their occupancy. Who is home, when they are not? Who will hear and react to the alarm? And so on. Less than half the protection the client anticipates is being provided if that system is not monitored.</p>
<p>IP (Internet protocol) cameras perform the exact same functions as their analog equivalents, however with vastly higher abilities. IP cameras boast sharper, greater resolution images and more flexible functions like remote zoom and repositioning. They also give you the alternative to view video footage on a web internet browser. This makes it possible to receive notifications regarding anything peculiar your cameras records-- such as movement inside your business at 3:00 am-- and see it live from anywhere by means of a computer or mobile phone. The major downside of IP cameras is their greater price tag.</p>
