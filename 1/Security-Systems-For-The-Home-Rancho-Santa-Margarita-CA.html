We've discovered lots here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, but you'll find more than 30 brands readily available. Often you don't have a choice. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT use only expert installation. But most other companies on our best home security systems list offer you a DIY option. ADT doesn't have the greatest client service reputation among the companies we considered, racking up more than 3,000 complaints on its Better Business Bureau page While we chalked most of this up to the truth that ADT has several million more customers than its rivals, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>

Not only is the Arlo fast to select moving products, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out exactly what it's taking a look at. Simply a couple decades earlier, the home security market was controlled by a couple of huge names using pricey, rigid strategies with little flexibility and unfriendly, long-lasting agreements. Systems were restricted to a couple wired motion sensing units linked to a keypad control board and go through a landline. Nowadays, this has all changed.</p>

<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to aim to make a camera with the most hard setup understood to man. Here's how it plays out: First you have to download the app and put in your e-mail address.

(You must play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pets growl, cats squeal, babies cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>
