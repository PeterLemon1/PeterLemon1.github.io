<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the porch by a certified electrical expert (who occurs to be my husband). All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router indoors (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>

<p>Another important topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much photo details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it comes to surveillance cameras, there are some tricky effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
