<p>No false alarm penalties: Homeowners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the cops for a false alarm. Considering that the property owner supervises of the system, police are only called if there's a genuine emergency situation.

If  cops are gotten in touch with for a false alarm, property owners might have to pay a fine for dispatching police unnecessarily. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for false alarms and subsequent charges.</p>
