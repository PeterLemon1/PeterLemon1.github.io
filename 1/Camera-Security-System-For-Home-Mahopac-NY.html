<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
