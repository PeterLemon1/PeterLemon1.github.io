<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security specialists researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can record approximately 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were often missing, despite appearing in the app's activity timeline.

Definitely not perfect-- but the representative apologized and shipped her replacement control panel over night.</p>
