<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, scams, and vandalism. Recommendation: Frequently keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again react to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one method of removing pricey false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a particular level, you can make it immediately switch off the heating unit. If the motion sensing units are activated, you can instantly make the wise lights turn on to scare away potential burglars.</p>
