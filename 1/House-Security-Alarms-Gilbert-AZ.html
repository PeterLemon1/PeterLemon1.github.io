<p>When your camera are installed, you can choose whether your cameras will be monitored by the main station. If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is generally done for cameras that are monitoring outdoor locations), then yes, central station operators will see the video that is tape-recorded when an alarm is set off. However, you may pick to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is normally done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, houses). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if requested by the client.</p>
<p>In response to the changing public communications network, new alarm systems frequently can use broadband signaling as a technique of alarm transmission, and producers are consisting of IP reporting capability straight in their alarm panel products.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
