It likewise comes with 2 days of complimentary cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can pack in clips of up to 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control panel and keypads, different sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes. When making a choice, they are the only company of the four discussed that uses a combination of wired and wireless technology so keep that in mind.</p>
