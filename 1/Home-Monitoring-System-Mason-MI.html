For example, if a customer declares to have actually acquired a pricey product however does not have the receipt, or that a worker was disrespectful or provided false information, video surveillance records can be used to identify whether they remained in the store on the day in question, and what, in fact, occurred.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers recognize that the affordable customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
