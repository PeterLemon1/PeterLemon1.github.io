<p>Pelco uses video surveillance cameras and video management solutions for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping others, centers, and hotels. IP cameras work by using an IP (IP stands for web protocol) network, typically the same information network the rest of a company utilizes. A separate network using category 5 circuitry can be used if bandwidth is a problem. Either way, video info is tape-recorded on a server, which means video information can be found on site or in a remote location. After testing, we sent out each of our top picks, along with the Wyze Webcam v2, to Expense McKinley, head of info security at The New york city Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack screening.
