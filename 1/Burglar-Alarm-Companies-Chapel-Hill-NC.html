<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we tested, and it offers two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our screening. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And despite having an appealing price and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise budget plan camera.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
