The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>

That's a high rate for home automation when compared to rivals like Vivint, which lets you add those features at every tier (starting at $40 each month).
