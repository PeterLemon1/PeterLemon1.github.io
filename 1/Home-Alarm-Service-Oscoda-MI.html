How did they do it? They placed 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their most current software application and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't state which device was the first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
