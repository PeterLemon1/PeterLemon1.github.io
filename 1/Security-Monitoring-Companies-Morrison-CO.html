<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against scams, theft, and vandalism. Suggestion: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We must once again react to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of removing expensive false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a particular level, you can make it instantly turn off the heating systems.
