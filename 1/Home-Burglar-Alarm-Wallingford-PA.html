Here's a take a look at Vivint security cameras for outdoor and indoor surveillance. Registered for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later. The company that installed my alarm failed so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions.
