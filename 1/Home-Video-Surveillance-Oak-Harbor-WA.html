<p>On the surface, these two camera categories may appear comparable, though if you were able to see within, the differences become apparent and unique. Commercial-grade cameras are created and built for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not. Normally, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is a lot of available light, and when the lighting becomes absent or low (believe sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to reveal.

<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies whenever you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
