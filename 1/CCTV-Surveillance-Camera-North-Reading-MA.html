<p>You can discover 2 kinds of security systems: expertly monitored and unmonitored.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and often over cross countries.

In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the need for further electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera separately, normally through 110VAC power.</p>
