As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
