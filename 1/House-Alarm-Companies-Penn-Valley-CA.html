<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
