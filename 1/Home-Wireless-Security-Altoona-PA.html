<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, covering a number of decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet budget friendly systems offered today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape video and enjoy it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
