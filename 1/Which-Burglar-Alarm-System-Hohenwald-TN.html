<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular considering that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
