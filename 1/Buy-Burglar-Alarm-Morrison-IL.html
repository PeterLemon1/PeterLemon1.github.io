By searching for the license plate numbers of cars parked at the club and researching the backgrounds of the automobiles' owners, he tried to blackmail customers who were wed.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
