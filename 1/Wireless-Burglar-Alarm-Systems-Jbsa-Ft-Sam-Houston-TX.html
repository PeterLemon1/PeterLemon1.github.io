<p>Another crucial subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image.

Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some challenging effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>
