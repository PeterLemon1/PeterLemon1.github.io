It's motion-activated and has a speaker system, letting you send out voice cautions through your phone. The lens covers 140 degrees and lets you focus on the action. Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to deliver on its guarantee of approximately one year of battery life. What we do not love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which ranged anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings. We have noticed some improvements since the camera's launch, and will continue to evaluate and upgrade this review, as required.</p>
