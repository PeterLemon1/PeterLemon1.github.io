<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, due to the fact that it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
