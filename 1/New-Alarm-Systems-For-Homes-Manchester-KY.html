<p>For the majority of commercial CCTV systems, structured cabling run throughout the walls, linking your security cameras to the server or NVR, will be a crucial part. While increasingly more wireless security cameras are becoming popular, particularly for home usage, wired security cameras still reign supreme for more permanent and demanding security use. Some people would rather pay an alarm company the regular monthly monitoring rate instead of buying a self-monitored security system. Expertly monitored security systems require a regular monthly monitoring cost that can vary from ($ 20 to $60) monthly. When identifying how much a burglar alarm expenses consumers need to realize that if they include more functions, the cost will increase.</p>
