'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge brother? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera could lawfully do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They could peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side.

<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our screening-- during the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based on offered bandwidth, which could change throughout the day.
