<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm, a number of companies provide "complimentary monitoring services" for the first few months. Numerous insurance companies use discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to consumers with operable alarm systems. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of authorities departments provide numerous "free" false alarms prior to enforcing any fine, although the cost to respond is significant right from the start.

Numerous systems need regular monthly payments, however not all. Some systems charge more up front, some systems feature expert installation, while others are completely Do It Yourself.
