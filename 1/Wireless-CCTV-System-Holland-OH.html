<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually mentioned, "knowing that you are being watched by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things.
