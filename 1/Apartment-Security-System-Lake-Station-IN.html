<p>The majority of modern-day CCTV video surveillance systems include DVRs (digital video recorders) which allow operators to reap a few of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs convert the analog video to digital, which helps to extend storage capability, makes it much easier to search archived footage, and likewise enables users to stream video over a network for remote watching from numerous areas. Frequently, the simple presence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated burglars. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or harmed by the more figured out burglars. If intruders can not see any security cameras, they might also be less careful about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
