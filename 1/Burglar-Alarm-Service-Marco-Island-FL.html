<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is definitely something to be thought about. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a great option for long variety scenarios where poles and trees are not present.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: incredibly conscious weather; as snow, rain, and fog, for example, would trigger the sensing units to stop working, and need sterilized perimeter line due to the fact that trees and bushes or anything that obstructs the beam would cause incorrect alarm or lack of detection.

However if your primary goal is keeping lawbreakers out of your house and securing your residential or commercial property, you do not need to invest a bundle.</p>
