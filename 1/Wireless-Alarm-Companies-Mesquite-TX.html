<p>Seeing angle: The camera's field of view determines how much it can see. As you're most likely monitoring a single space, you desire a broad viewing angle.

These broad angles can sometimes cause image distortion at the edges in the form of a fisheye effect, particularly when utilized in smaller rooms, however it's not like you're going to utilize a security to catch pictures for your picture album.</p>
<p>Another method to store recordings on a non-analogue media is through making use of a digital video recorder (DVR). Such a device is comparable in functionality to a PC with a capture card and suitable video recording software Unlike PCs, many DVRs created for CCTV purposes are embedded devices that require less maintenance and simpler setup than a PC-based solution, for a medium to a a great deal of analogue cameras.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers complimentary benefits like person detection, familiar-face alerts, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 per month.) However, in our tests the familiar-face informs worked just about 50 percent of the camera and the time routinely disconnected from the network several times a day (when whatever else on our network appeared fine). The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and recorded clips, in addition to when we made modifications in the settings.</p>
