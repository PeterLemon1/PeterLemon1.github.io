<p>Most home security systems involve DIY installation of surveillance equipment, so I make sure that that's a simple process. I observe the process and make sure that the cost isn't too high if a home security company only offers professional installation.

<p>Nurse calling systems typically include emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's bathroom. If a patient is having difficulty, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is a basic switch that is typically open or generally closed. The majority of your commercial security cameras include dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and notifies, sensors, gain access to control, and so on.

<p>Keypad: A mobile phone app is a must for usage when you're far from home, however you shouldn't have to fumble with your phone when you're going and coming.
