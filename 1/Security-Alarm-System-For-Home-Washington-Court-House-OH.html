<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. While burglar alarm technology has established considerably considering that the 19th century, it is still based on the basic concepts innovated by Augustus Pope and Alexander Bell. All major alarm companies, including Mijac Alarm, utilize distance sensing units in the windows and doors as the first line of defense versus prospective robbers, and alarm send information to a central monitoring station that can dispatch law enforcement rapidly and efficiently.</p>

After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
