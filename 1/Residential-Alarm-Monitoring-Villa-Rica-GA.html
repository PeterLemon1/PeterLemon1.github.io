<p>SimpliSafe might be too minimal for you if you have a bigger home or property you want to keep an eye on. The only outdoor security camera that's presently readily available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is great for keeping an eye on visitors and plan shipments, however it leaves other parts of your lawn vulnerable. If you have a big yard or outbuildings to protect, this system may not be the best fit. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q doesn't need a base station-- it links directly to any Wi-Fi network. But you can link the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is offered for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web browser.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
