In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

DVRs convert the analog footage to digital, which assists to extend storage capability, makes it a lot easier to browse archived video footage, and also enables users to stream video over a network for remote viewing from multiple places. Often, the simple presence of security cameras can scare away less-motivated trespassers. But keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being damaged or damaged by the more figured out intruders. They might also be less mindful about covering their faces and their tracks if burglars can not see any security cameras.</p>
