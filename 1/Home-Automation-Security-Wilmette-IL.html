<p>We still think the Ring Alarm is a great choice for a cheap home security system with smart home assistance. But maybe skip the cameras for now. Hard disk drive storage is safe, secure, and practical, with many systems offering expansion and totally free cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll require to manually remove to move the data? Does it go to your smartphone, or upload to services like Dropbox?
