<p>The Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is one of the most expensive home security cameras around, but it's also among the most intelligent, too. This weatherproof home security camera has a tamper-resistant style, a triple microphone range and HDR assistance for better-quality videos than what other cameras produce. It needs to be plugged in to work-- no battery choice here, sorry-- but the camera features a 25-foot power cable, which should assist with installation.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
