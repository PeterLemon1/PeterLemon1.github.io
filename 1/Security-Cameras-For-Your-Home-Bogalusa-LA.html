<p>Given that the glass real estate doesn't get in the way, they aren't rather as vandal-proof as dome cameras, however they make up for it in capabilities.

With some, it's hard to tell at a glimpse where they've been intended, so they can provide a panoptic impression as a deterrent, regardless of their true field of vision.

These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is really fantastic.
