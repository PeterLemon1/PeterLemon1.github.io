<p>The implicit reason for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. But suicide aggressors are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and might even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expenditure of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up around 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget plan - far goes beyond the restricted advantages that the system may supply in examining attacks or tried attacks after the truth (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>The bright side is that the WPA3 is currently here and will replace WPA2. The Wi-Fi Alliance just recently announced its next-generation wireless network security standard which aims to resolve a common security issue: open Wi-Fi networks.

These housings include heating systems, not only to keep the equipment warm in subzero temperature levels, but also to prevent the dome or window from misting up in damp and cool weather condition.</p>
