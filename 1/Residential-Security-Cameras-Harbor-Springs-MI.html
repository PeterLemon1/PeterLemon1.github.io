<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the producer's statistics considering that this originates from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest perpetrator for short battery life without a doubt.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic.
