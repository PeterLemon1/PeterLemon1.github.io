The video recorder should be purchased individually, and commercial grade recorders begin at about $500 (United States $) and can range approximately $5000 depending upon the quantity of storage, camera connection, and image processing features.</p>
<p>Surveillance cameras are one of the most identifiable and ubiquitous innovations used to enjoy us as we move about our daily lives.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
