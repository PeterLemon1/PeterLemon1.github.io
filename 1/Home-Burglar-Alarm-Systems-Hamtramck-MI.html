<p>Are alarms a effective and reliable  method to capture robbers? Although theft stays one of the most frequently reported criminal activities, the clearance rate for U.S. thefts has stayed below 15 percent for many years. 14 Plainly, whatever contribution burglar alarms are making to resolving break-in cases is modest, at best. Some smart alarms consist of or can be used with wifi security cameras from the same maker.
