Some alarm companies deliberately program interaction delays into their home alarm system. These delays, which can be as long as four minutes, are installed to cut down on false alarms. Our systems are set so that we get your alarm signal instantly.</p>
<p>ADT offers you lots of alternatives. You can lease a system from them or buy monitoring for an existing system. They can monitor equipment made by a lot of the leading brands.
