<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

We concur with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capacity is a bit limited to suggest as a top choice.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe's 3 essential strengths are its ease of usage, the number and variety of pre-designed security packages they use, and their robust trial and warranty durations. The company's equipment features a clean, modern, practically minimalist style that does not visually overwhelm the user. And it offers 20 various system packages, 16 of which for the latest variation of their security equipment and 4 for their tradition system.

<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be convenient for installation. Due to the fact that it does not have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Sadly I acquired 4 cameras that look much like these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Young boy was I wrong!! These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is really terrific. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
