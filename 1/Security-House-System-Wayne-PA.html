<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you walk by.
