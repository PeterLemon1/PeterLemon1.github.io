When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.

Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
