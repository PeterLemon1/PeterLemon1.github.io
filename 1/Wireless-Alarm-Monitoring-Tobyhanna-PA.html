<p>B. The owner shall make sure all burglar alarm systems are maintained per manufacturer specs and adopted codes. The camera's seeing angle determines just how much area the camera will cover.

After reading the talk about this page I went to Armorax's website to see what they offered; they've partnered with another security company and their starter plan I believe starts at $0 down. The panel and sensing units are Qolsys, so that's good. Monitoring is priced well too, so all in all a lot.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
