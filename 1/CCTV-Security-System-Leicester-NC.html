Tenants, unlike homeowners, typically prevent making permanent changes to their homes.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
