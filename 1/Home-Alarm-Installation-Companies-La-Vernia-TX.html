Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your e-mail address. Then you go into the WiFi information of the network you're attempting to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi information. (You must play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pet dogs shout, felines shriek, babies sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>
<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

Screens can be linked to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be set up to communicate via network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
