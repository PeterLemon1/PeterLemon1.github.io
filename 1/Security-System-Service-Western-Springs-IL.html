That's a high price for home automation when compared to rivals like Vivint, which lets you add those functions at every tier (starting at $40 each month).

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
