<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually set up on the patio by a certified electrical expert (who happens to be my hubby).

<p>The Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is among the most pricey home security cameras around, but it's also among the smartest, too.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
