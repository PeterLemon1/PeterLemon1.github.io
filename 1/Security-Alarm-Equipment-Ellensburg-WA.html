Some zones may trigger a call to the local heating oil company to go examine the system, or a call to the owner with details of which room might be getting flooded.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
