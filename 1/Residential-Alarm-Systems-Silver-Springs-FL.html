<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or house is the duty of the whole community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you mean to store and the length of time you plan to keep documented video. If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video footage is going to eat up storage space quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video as soon as you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>
<p>Frame rate: This is another key element of a camera-- the higher the frame rate, the smoother the video. Video is just a series of still images sewn together to create a movie.

For reference, "real time" is typically measured as 30 frames per second.
