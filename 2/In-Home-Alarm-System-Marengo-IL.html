<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or home is the duty of the entire community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a number of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you plan to save and how long you prepare to keep documented footage.
