The normal reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering an opportunity for the destructive opponent to tape these codes and use various cracking tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based upon the "design" security essential recorded during the network recovery.</p>
