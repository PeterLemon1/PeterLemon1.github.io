<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a brief explanation of how thermal cameras work: All things produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy given off by an item is known as its heat signature. In general, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that is capable of finding tiny distinctions in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from things in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon info about the temperature level distinctions.

Then you get in the WiFi details of the network you're attempting to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to send the WiFi details. (You must play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pets wail, felines scream, children weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds.
