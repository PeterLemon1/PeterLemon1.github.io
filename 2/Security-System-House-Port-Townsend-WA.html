<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical since the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level.
