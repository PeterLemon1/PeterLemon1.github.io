<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature.

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
