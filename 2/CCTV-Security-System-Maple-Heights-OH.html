<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
