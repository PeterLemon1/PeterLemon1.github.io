<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment this way to make consumers stay with them longer, because changing monitoring companies implies hundreds of dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for customers. How did they do it? They positioned five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their most current software and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't say which device was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
