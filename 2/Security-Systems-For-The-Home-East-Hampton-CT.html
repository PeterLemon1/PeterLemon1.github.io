<p>Discover how to create, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and lower criminal activity. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with awful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.
