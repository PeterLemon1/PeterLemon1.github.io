<p>CCTV cameras are positioned in areas where they are thought to be most effective, which typically consists of extremely populated towns, town hall, parking area, or numerous other high-crime locations (Welsh and Farrington 2008). Given that the positioning of these cameras is really important, the crime patterns in areas of interest are usually studied for periods of time to determine criminal activity hotspots where cameras might possibly be put.

ADT's 6 customer monitoring centers (more than any other security company has) make certain your security never ever goes offline.
