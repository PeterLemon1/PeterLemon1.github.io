<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
