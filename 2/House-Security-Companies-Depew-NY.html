<p>Smoke and smoke alarm alert you if they identify a high-level of smoke or if the temperature level increases too quickly, either of which might show a fire. The majority of homes currently have wireless smoke or emergency alarm, but you can link the alarm to your security system to add another layer of protection that could save your life or property.
