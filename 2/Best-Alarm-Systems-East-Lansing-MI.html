<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our screening-- during the day and at night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the photo quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.
