<p>No incorrect alarm penalties: House owners with a self-monitored system are less most likely to dispatch the cops for a false alarm. Because the house owner is in charge of the system, authorities are just called if there's a genuine emergency. On the other hand, a professional monitoring company will call police if a property owner can't validate an incorrect alarm. If  police are called for a false alarm, homeowners may need to pay a fine for dispatching cops unnecessarily. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for incorrect alarms and subsequent charges.</p>

<p>4G Wireless works comparable to a mobile phone. The modem links to the internet much like a cell phone.
