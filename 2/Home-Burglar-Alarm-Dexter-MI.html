Throughout our hands-on testing of Brinks, we discovered the systems to be rather simple to establish and utilize-- however not rather as simple as brands like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.</p>
<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most cost-efficient monitoring plan starting at $10. You can get all the basics like email, push, and SMS informs, as well as 4G LTE cellular backup and battery for Scout's cheapest, Constantly On" plan.
