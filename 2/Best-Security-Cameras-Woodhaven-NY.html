<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
