<p>Discover how to create, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and lower criminal activity. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with terrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our system was defective, therefore we may revisit this review. Essentially, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last 5 days of video footage to the cloud.
