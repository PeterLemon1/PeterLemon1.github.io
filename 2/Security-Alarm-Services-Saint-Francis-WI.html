By looking up the license plate varieties of parking lot at the club and researching the backgrounds of the cars' owners, he tried to blackmail patrons who were married. Envision what somebody like that could do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers understand that the economical customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
