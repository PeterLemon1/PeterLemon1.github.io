The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
