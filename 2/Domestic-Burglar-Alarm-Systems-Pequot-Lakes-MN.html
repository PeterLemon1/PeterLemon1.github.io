<p>Nurse calling systems normally consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's restroom.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic.
