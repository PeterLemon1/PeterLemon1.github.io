<p>The videos your camera records probably won't be saved on the camera itself. The majority of home security cameras utilize cloud services to store and use remote access to video Some models have microSD card slots so you can physically pull the video from them when you want to evaluate footage, but this is a rare function. Still, if technology has made us vulnerable, then it can likewise make us secure. Tech companies have been pressing difficult to innovate in the linked home CCTV camera area.

Nevertheless, remember that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a personal security guard. A number of cities also require a license to even run a home and own security system.

<p>The genuine factor cameras are usually deployed is to reduce much pettier criminal offenses. But it has not even been demonstrated that they can do that.

"As soon as the criminal activity and offence figures were adjusted to appraise the basic downward trend in offences and criminal activities," criminologists found in one study, "decreases were noted in particular categories but there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had lowered criminal offense in general in the city centre."
