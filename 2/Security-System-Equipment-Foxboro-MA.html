<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate in between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a normal camera image. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to fix detail after the reality, which means that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and take up a lot of recording storage area. So much, in truth, that they require about four times the hard disk drive space of 1080p to tape the very same length of video footage. Be prepared to spend more money if extended video storage is important.</p>
<p>Some security systems require incorporating your new system with your existing wiring which suggests you will need to have the right tools for the task. Anytime you're dealing with wiring and electrical energy, you actually need to understand exactly what you're doing and have the tools to do it properly. Otherwise, you could wind up damaging your new equipment, your existing electrical wiring, or producing a fire danger if it is not set up properly. So unless you truly understand what you're doing, you should probably opt for professional installation, particularly if your new security system will need to be hardwired. Many on the market today are relatively instinctive and easy to install if you choose a Do It Yourself wireless security system. And, many of them do not require any unique tools or knowledge to finish the job.</p>
