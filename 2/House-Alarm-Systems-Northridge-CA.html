<p>Alarm systems have actually become standard equipment in shops and other organisations, and they're becoming significantly typical in personal homes also. Life can get chaotic sometimes, and it can be tough tracking everything around you. Thankfully, a surveillance camera can lend an additional pair of eyes and serve as lookout for you and your family.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal considering that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers recognize that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally described as shock sensors, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Usually, the most intense frequencies generated are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
