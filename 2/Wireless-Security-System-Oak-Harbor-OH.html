<p>3 big advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their expandability, mobility and impermanence. Renters, unlike property owners, usually prevent making long-term modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and installing permanent electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entryways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other parts can quickly be set up at different residential or commercial properties later, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new elements too. Wireless security plans also allow push-button control of the system and basic home automation.

For example, you can have a wise plug turn on a light inside or activate an external siren when the camera discovers motion.</p>
