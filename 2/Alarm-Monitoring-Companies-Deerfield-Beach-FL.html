<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
