<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
