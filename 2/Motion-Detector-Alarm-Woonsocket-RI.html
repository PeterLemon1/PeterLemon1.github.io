<h3>Wireless CCTV Camera Woonsocket RI 02895</h3>
<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you need additional cable televisions. DVR systems are tough to scale up because when every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to acquire an entirely new DVR before adding another camera to the system. DVRs likewise require that the connected cameras be in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to deteriorate.</p>
