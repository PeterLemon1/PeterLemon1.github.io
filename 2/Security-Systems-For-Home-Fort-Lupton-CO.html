It likewise features two days of complimentary cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can pack in clips of as much as 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips.

Sadly I acquired 4 cameras that look similar to these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is actually fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
