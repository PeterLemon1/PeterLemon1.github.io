Video can be conserved to an optional microSD card in each camera, but is likewise saved for 14 days in the cloud totally free, which is a fantastic touch. We do not love the rate. Vivint's regular monthly monitoring service plans aren't too expensive, but its equipment costs a pretty cent. Get ready to pay out several hundred dollars for just your starter package.</p>
<p>Speaking of recordings, BT are distinctly generous with their cloud-based storage.
