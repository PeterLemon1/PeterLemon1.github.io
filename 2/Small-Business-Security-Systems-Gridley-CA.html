<h3>House Security System Cost in Gridley CA</h3>

<p>We like that the Argus 2 comes with a color night vision alternative, however the white and black version can actually be clearer and give you higher-quality footage. This isn't actually a big deal considering the Argus 2's price and all its other functions-- however for the record, stick to black and white.

Sensing units - Most clever alarm manufacturers provide a mix of sensing units in an alarm package, so you'll need to exercise the combination you require for your home. Take into account the height the alarm manufacturer recommends motion sensors must be installed at (this can be anywhere between 8ft and 5ft) to guarantee any pet's will not activate the sensor.</p>
