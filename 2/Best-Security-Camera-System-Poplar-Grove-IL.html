<p>Analog hd cameras are a great option for companies to upgrade from analog CCTV that has actually already been wired using coax cable television or CAT-5 cable television. AHD cameras utilize the very same RG59 or RG6 cable television as traditional CCTV cameras. CAT-5 cable television with video baluns can likewise be utilized.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally described as shock sensors, are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most extreme frequencies produced are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
