<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle however profound changes to the character of our public areas. When people are being watched by the authorities - or conscious they might be watched at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "understanding that you are being watched by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things.

Eventually, he alerts, "individuals might find out to be careful about the periodicals and books they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers.
