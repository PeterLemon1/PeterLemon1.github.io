The truth that you can purchase extra sensing units suggests that you can include sensing units in different rooms around your house at a cheap cost so you can monitor different zones separately.

<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped case that the camera sits in. Whilst these are fairly discreet CCTV cameras in appearance, this doesn't stop them from hindering criminals.

<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, dealing with sophisticated smart home enthusiasts or fans of a specific ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I tested, including clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system.
