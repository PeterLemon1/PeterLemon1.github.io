<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you stroll by.
