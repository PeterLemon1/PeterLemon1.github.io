<p>Flood lights are typically used in conjunction with motion detectors. When sensors find movement, the lights illuminate the surrounding location, which will permit you to see who is on your property and will potentially frighten trespassers. Better outdoor lighting also suggests a clearer video for any outside cameras you have. When choosing flood lights, think about the brightness and distance the light shines. Flood lights can prevent vandals or terrify them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your assurance than for home protection.</p>
