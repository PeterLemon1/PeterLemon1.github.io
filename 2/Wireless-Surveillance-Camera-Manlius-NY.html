<p>Twenty-five years back, basic and business interactions were primarily simultaneous. To accomplish almost anything, someone live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, particularly when handling nationwide and worldwide business.

<p>Our alarm systems may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize an infraction. When a zone has actually been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
