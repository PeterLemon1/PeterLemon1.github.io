Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to send the WiFi details. (You should play this at full volume or it will not work). Windows smash, canines shout, cats scream, children weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first ten seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>
