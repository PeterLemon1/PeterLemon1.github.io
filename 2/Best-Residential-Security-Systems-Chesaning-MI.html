However, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are huge and take up a lot of recording storage space. So much, in reality, that they need about 4 times the disk drive space of 1080p to tape the same length of video footage. If extended video storage is crucial, be prepared to invest more money.</p>
