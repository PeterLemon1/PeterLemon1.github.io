But Netatmo has expanded its security variety with a fantastic outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units called Tags (₤ 89.99).

Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
