<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera.

DVRs likewise require that the connected cameras remain in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to degrade.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
