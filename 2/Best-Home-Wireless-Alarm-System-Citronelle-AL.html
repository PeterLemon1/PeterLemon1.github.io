Some individuals may state that we need to not have surveillance cameras in public locations. They declare that they invade privacy. The argument here, nevertheless, is why be out in public if you want personal privacy? Surveillance cameras are meant to keep you and other property safe, not to stalk you.

An advanced kind of CCTV, making use of digital video recorders (DVRs), provides taping for perhaps many years, with a range of quality and efficiency alternatives and extra functions (such as motion detection and email alerts).

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the producer's statistics since this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest culprit for brief battery life without a doubt.
