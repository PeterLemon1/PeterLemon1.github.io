<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, vandalism, and scams. Tip: Typically keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset.

For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it immediately switch off the heater. You can instantly make the clever lights turn on to terrify away potential intruders if the motion sensors are triggered.</p>
