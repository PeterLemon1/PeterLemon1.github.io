<h3>House Alarm Companies Palmetto GA 30268</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never ever matches the maker's stats because this originates from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest offender for short battery life without a doubt. We concur with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capability is a bit restricted to suggest as a top choice.</p>
<p>When looking at a regular camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the distinction in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to fix information after the fact, which means that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it likewise brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are very large and take up a lot of tape-recording storage area. So much, in reality, that they need about four times the disk drive space of 1080p to record the very same length of video footage. Be prepared to spend more money if extended video storage is essential.</p>
<p>The 2nd wireless function has to do with how your security system communicates with the alarm monitoring station.

So, how do we get your alarm to communicate with the monitoring station? Much in the same method you do - we can link via the web or by means of a wireless cellular phone signal.</p>
