<p>If a staff member (relied on entity) generates a wireless router and plugs it into an unsecured switchport, the entire network can be exposed to anybody within range of the signals. Similarly, if a staff member includes a wireless interface to a networked computer using an open USB port, they might develop a breach in network security that would permit access to confidential products.
