The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
