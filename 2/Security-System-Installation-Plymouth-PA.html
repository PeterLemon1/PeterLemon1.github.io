<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the precise very same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred.
