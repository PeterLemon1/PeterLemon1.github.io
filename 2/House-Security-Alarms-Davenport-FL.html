The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our screening, nevertheless, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with terrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.
