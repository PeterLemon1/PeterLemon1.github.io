<p>In The Sims, an alarm system will cover an entire room when put inside. It will cover a 5-tile radius if placed on an outside wall. When a provider allows consumers to monitor their own homes, this is called self-monitoring." Customers can monitor their homes with the help of motion detectors, sensors, and security cameras. In this case, the provider usually has a mobile app that consumers can use to get signals on their phones. For the most part, clients can also inspect the app to see live video footage from security cameras.</p>
<p>And it does not cost that far more to trick out your system with doorbell cameras, floodlights, and outdoor security cameras.
