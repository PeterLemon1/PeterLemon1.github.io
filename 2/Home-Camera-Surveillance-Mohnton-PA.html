<p>3 big benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their expandability, impermanence and portability. Occupants, unlike homeowners, typically avoid making permanent modifications to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entryways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other parts can quickly be established at different properties later on, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new elements too.
