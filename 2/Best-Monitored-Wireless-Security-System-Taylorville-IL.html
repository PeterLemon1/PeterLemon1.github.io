SimpliSafe is not terrific at wise home support. It deals with Amazon Alexa, and it uses its own clever door lock, but you can't go setting up many third-party devices with your SimpliSafe system. It doesn't deal with Z-Wave or IFTTT, and we do not expect it to include extra functionality anytime quickly.</p>
