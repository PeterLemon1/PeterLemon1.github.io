<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and fraud. Suggestion: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We must again respond to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one method of getting rid of costly incorrect alarms.
