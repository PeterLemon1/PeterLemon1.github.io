Because the property owner is in charge of the system, authorities are just contacted if there's a real emergency situation. On the other hand, an expert monitoring company will call cops if a property owner can't validate a false alarm.

In the London subway bombings in 2005, terrorists carried bombs onto trains and buses, detonating them during heavy traffic.

The terrorists were taped on several CCTV cameras, however unfortunately they were neither observed nor intercepted before they were able to carry out the attacks.</p>

It also makes your camera more tamper-proof due to the fact that it does not have wires that can be cut. Unfortunately I bought 4 cameras that look similar to these, believing I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Boy was I wrong!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is actually fantastic. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
