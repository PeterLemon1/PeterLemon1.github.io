<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and fraud. Idea: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of removing expensive incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it immediately shut off the heating systems.
