The master control board is the center of the security system. When any of the security sensing units are breached by an intruder, the control panel relays a message to the monitoring service or sets off your home-mounted alarm.</p>
<p>IP cameras likewise have extra features that analog cameras do not use, such as video analytics, which permit mobile notifications and automated recording if there is motion within the camera's field of view. When your business is closed and you desire to know if someone is moving around inside the properties, this is particularly useful for times.
