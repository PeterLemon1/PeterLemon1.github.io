The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly developed into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems readily available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape video and see it later on.
