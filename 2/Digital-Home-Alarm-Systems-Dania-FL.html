<p>Potentially. It depends upon which security company you select. Lots of professionally monitored home security systems need an agreement, and contract length can range from three to five years. However today you'll find more home security alternatives than ever prior to that offer shorter contracts and month-to-month (contract-free) terms-- especially if you can pay for equipment up front.

Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I checked, including creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. But the Secure is expensive, extra sensing units are costly, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also expensive if you don't dedicate to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>The least expensive, $240 for Outdoor Base, offers you an Echo Dot plus outdoor and indoor lighting designed to make it look like you're home."
