Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
